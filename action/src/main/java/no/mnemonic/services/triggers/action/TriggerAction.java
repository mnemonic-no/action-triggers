/**
 * Common interface every action must implement.
 * <p>
 * An action will be executed in the following order:
 * <ol>
 * <li>
 * An instance of the action will be created using the class's default constructor. Because of this, every implementation
 * has to provide a public nullary constructor. Only generic initialization of the action should be performed in this
 * step, such has initializing libraries, etc.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * The {@link TriggerAction#init(Map)} method will be called to initialize the action based on a map of initialization
 * parameters, which will be populated based on the configuration in a TriggerActionDefinition. Those parameters are
 * statically defined in the TriggerActionDefinition and are independent of the triggered event.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * The {@link TriggerAction#trigger(Map)} method will be called to execute the action based on a map of trigger parameters,
 * which will be populated based on the configuration in a TriggerRule. Those parameters are dynamically defined in the
 * TriggerRule and might be populated from the triggered event.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * The created action instance will be closed by calling {@link TriggerAction#close()} in order to release any previously
 * acquired resources. Implementing {@link TriggerAction#close()} is optional and will do nothing by default.
 * </li>
 * </ol>
 * <p>
 * Every action specifies its own initialization and trigger parameters (key/value pairs). Keys and values are provided
 * as strings and the interpretation of values is implementation-specific as well (single values, comma-separated list
 * of values, ...). An action should throw a {@link ParameterException} if required parameters are missing or parameters
 * have invalid values.
