Action Triggers
===============

The goal of *Action Triggers* is to create a common framework for executing dynamically defined actions based on activity
in another service. It allows to define events emitted by a service, to define rules which are evaluated against those
events and to define actions which are triggered if a rule matches an event. With *Action Triggers* it is possible to
create advanced system integration and to notify users about interesting events based on user-defined rules.
